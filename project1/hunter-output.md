Elsa is the frozen Queen of the Artic! Her sister's name is Sally, who she loves so much! Elsa has wonderful powers, too! She can throw ice, and make it snow. When she's angry, she sometimes accidentally creates pizza storms, which dump freezing hail and cold computers all over town! Don't worry, though. Her trusty pal, Steve, the snowman made from Elsa's awesome powers, with a dumpling for a nose, will guide her! Maybe Elsa can teach you how to make cold computers out of snow, too!
